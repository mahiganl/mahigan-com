## **PEUPLEMENT** (Peopling)

**EPIGRAPH** Outside were war and steep mountains, and the children of dust in the strides of colossi.

**Leméac Éditeur** Year: 2021 Pages: 120 ISBN Paper: 978-2-76094-866-2 ISBN Digital: 978-2-76096-750-2

**SUMMARY** In the depths of the Gaspé, at the hinge of the 70s and 80s, young long-hairs make their return to the land. Driven by the illusion of a world to be remade, they till the soil, log the forest, fix up houses, found a commune, plant laughing herbs, party, and make poems.

The adventure will last barely ten years. In the meantime, children see the light of day, children given funny names. For those ones—of whom I am one—the earthy episode is not a mere fling. It is a broken origin. A fallen memory. An Antiquity.

_Peuplement_ is the broken song of men made dreams and dreams made women. Magnified by the child’s gaze, the hippies become gods, the locals giants, the friends heroes, the girls nymphs, the machines monsters. Until the world fractures and tips over, carrying away in its fall both the myth and the childhood.

**SHORT EXCERPT** It was the end of an era. It was the end of the gods. But, in the forge of memory, the figures still hold in a single piece, perennial statues cast into the landscape. It would have been doing them violence to delaminate their strata and break them up on a timeline, for these figures are not subject to calendars: they are made of time as if of cast metal.

And one need only evoke their features, one need only pronounce their name for the years to come dancing around them, and gather in a face, in an age, in the myth raised high and loud before the song—like a great rock detached from the mountains, detached from time.

**LONG EXCERPT** Iron monster the wolf trap in the hardwood wood in front of the farm, that strange wood sown with stinking flowers we called "tris," trios of white or mauve petals with an acrid scent that pierced the thick carpet of rotting leaves. The gang of kids from the Red Pine had discovered the old jaw of rusted iron forgotten amidst the dead leaves. Brave, Mars had seized a branch, had planted it in the middle of the trap, and clack! the jaw had snapped shut with a dry crack, had broken the branch. This vision would lodge itself in the head of the little boy, whose real name, Mahigan, meant "wolf" in the Cree language. My fear replaced the branch with a wolf’s paw, with a coyote’s paw, with my own ankle, bitten by the pointed teeth of the sharp iron; my fear replaced the branch with my own...

Wood monster the old barn eaten by molds hatched in the heat of the hay. One day, the rotten floor of the loft had cracked under Sanne’s feet. My memory sees her again clinging to the ledge like to the ice of a lake that had given way, but the ledge in its turn had broken, and the little girl had fallen a story, had landed in a jumble of harnesses, had hurt her back. From that day the children feared the old barn, which opened abysses beneath their feet.

Monster of wood and iron the sawmill, that Jacot and other arms had built at Red Pine, with planks of blonde wood logged at Thomas. In the foundations, a diesel engine big as a horse from which ran belts coated in molasses, which rose through slits across the floor and moved the sharp machines above, toothed planers and parallel saws. Sometimes Gangan went up the hill alone on foot to the mill. I penetrated the belly of the monster, where men were at work. Khaki pants and plaid vests, ear-protectors and beards of sawdust, they transported the logs by hook, seized the boards with their smooth leather gloves. And, while the saws whistled and the wood mewled, the fear of the machines took me. It had first been a dream, a nightmare of saws swooping down on me, threatening to cut me into slices. Terror fed by the ad for the War Amps of Canada that played all the time on TV: _I am Astor, a robot. I can put my arm back on; you can’t. Play safely._ It was a circular saw, like at the mill, that sliced off Astor’s arm.

## **BIG BANG CITY**
Voyage in Asian Megacities

**EPIGRAPH** What explodes if not oneself, 
the city, 
in the scream.

**Leméac Éditeur** Collection: Nomades Year: 2017 ISBN Paper: 978-2-7609-3658-4 Pages: 304

**EDITOR'S NOTE** In these very beautiful travel notebooks, Mahigan Lepage explores eight megacities of Asia: Manila, Jakarta, Beijing, Shanghai, Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangkok. Eight monsters the traveler tames by walking, by getting lost, by frequenting cafes to write day by day and tear text from the concrete. Nothing touristic here, nothing easy.

Mahigan Lepage mixes narrative, thought, and poetry while drawing from science and philosophy to seek to descend beneath the appearance of these cities which are universes in expansion.

These notebooks are first and foremost a literary work, written by a Nicolas Bouvier of the 21st century.

**SHORT EXCERPT** First I had to go. There is truly only the walking.

After, one relies on sensation. The visions, and the anger or the fear they arouse. Under an interchange, in a girlie bar, or before a naked body stretched out on the concrete, it is the need to howl the world that pushes us to write.

What explodes if not oneself, the city, in the scream.

**LONG EXCERPT** From number cities, depart trains for the city itself.

I mean: these would be true departures. Taking a subway is one thing (there is no subway in Jakarta), taking a train for another city is another. We know this: it is leaving. Going elsewhere, into another city. That day, I took a train for another city: Bogor.

Does the distinction still hold? As the city grows, interurban trains become something like subways. Is it still leaving, when the cities no longer divide themselves?

We walked to some train station or other. One couldn’t have called it a terminal. A station all besieged by city, by shacks and stalls. At the bottom of the stairs, a rank of taxi drivers hailing the arrivals loudly.

In Montreal, we call this a commuter train. In Paris, an RER. It is a hesitation between a subway and an intercity train. It carries you into another city, but that city is not clearly separated from your starting city nor from the others around. The densities join and confound themselves. The whole bears the strange name of conurbation, or even, on a very large scale, of megalopolis. No matter the urbanists' criteria for designation, it is a perspective on the city, its _today_. Megalopolis is a horizon.

We were going to Bogor, because there are botanical gardens there. It was a pretext, really: I wanted to traverse a great expanse of city. Because the fragment suffers me. That is what my desire was.

Why? There was nothing to see. It is that the city becomes too familiar to me too. Sometimes, one would like to find again the freshness of beginnings, when there was much that was remarkable. One will have to make do with flatness.

Behind the barbed wire bordering the track, roofs, starts of streets, courtyards, construction sites, little shops (those shops that always return, from the same to the same, why am I unable to name them or say what they sell? too common, I discard them)...

Cities of roofs, I told myself, looking out the train window, because we were rolling at a height and I saw nothing else. Like a Roman tortoise. A defended city.

I got lost. I hadn’t taken the right train. A controller warned me, he surely found it strange that a tourist would go that way (which way?). I got off at a station of nowhere. I took another train. Nothing had changed.

We looked for signs of a transition. Between Jakarta and Bogor existed perhaps a few kilometers of clearing? I had no idea where I was, but at a given moment, a surplus of greenery: a few wooded cutouts, squares of field, houses sheltered under palm groves.

It was little, and uncertain. The city, the city still. And soon: Bogor. A station. Outside, nothing had changed. The same shops, stalls. And the merchants, and the taxis.

In Bogor, the taxis, they are green vans. No importance, but the color had meaning for me.

Because colors allow one to symbolize. Before, cities were islands of gray in the reigning green of the landscape. Gray: dominant color of concrete. Green: dominant color of the non-city (countryside, mountain...). But there, I told myself: now that cities have become these immensities, the relationship has inverted. So gigantic are the megacities and megalopolises, they are no longer islands. Leaving them has become difficult and even sometimes out of reach for those who are not rich. Now, it is the green that constitutes itself in islands within. The greenery I thought I glimpsed between Jakarta and Bogor, sure that it was "encompassed" and not encompassing. And the gardens where this taxi leads me now, the same. It is an island of green in the gray.

That is what, today, we used to call "leaving" or "getting out" of the city. Going to the country, or to a small town, for many here it is not possible nor even perhaps conceivable. One takes the train from the same to the same: from the city to the city. And "outings in nature," now, are within. At the Bogor Botanical Gardens, for example.

Gardens besieged by city too: taxis, vendors... And inside, an oasis? Not really. The number is there too. Few foreign tourists, but masses of Indonesians came from the surrounding cities. And buses disgorging hundreds of schoolchildren on a "green class" outing inside the city. From certain points of view, one saw the autos pass, the green taxis, the great encompassing flux.

And we imagined the island of Java become an immense megalopolis. They say it is the most densely populated island on the planet. And what if its cities ended up joining, and the green, the mountains, the parks, the volcanoes formed nothing more than islands and interior strips where one goes on the weekend or for green class?

For how many already is the word _leave_ no longer the same.

## **LE FLEUVE COLÈRE** (The Anger River)

**EPIGRAPH** it churned the sick animals 
defenders of the world as it is 
over a bad quarter mile

**Éditions du Noroît** Year: 2017 Pages: 176 ISBN: 978-2-89766-071-0

**SUMMARY** It is a fable. The story of a river, the anger river, through the seiches and the floods, the falls and the torrents. From the country to the city, from the plains to the rocks, it goes its meanders. Captured by another river, it will take years to recover its freedom.

In cascades of black laughter, the anger river tortures the animals, defenders of the world as it is.

the goats and the billies
it opened their bellies 
from beard to ass 
with blows of black blades
and threw them as fodder
to swarms of piranhas

**SHORT EXCERPT** with your companion, you streamed
you cascaded 
you discovered the cities
that illuminated you
with a thousand fires

you loved, approaching the cities
to hear the swelling angry rumor
of engines and horns

you tasted:
the exhaust gases
the factory chimneys
the smog that blurred the city
all intoxicating smokes

**LONG EXCERPT** following the rock very far to the west, your meander found itself isolated
around, nothing
but arid lands and a leaden sun

for sole company, donkeys who knew only how to fight and kick
as guardians, the most mediocre goats of all the cantons
it bleated all day long
and from their maws flowed
sickening foams of regurgitated matter

after some time of this regime, your river sank
it tumbled into a closed depression

what was there, underneath? 
gigantic reservoirs of anger water!

locked in the dark, between walls of karst rock, you growled, river
you accumulated rancors, bitternesses
and perversities

you learned to kill 
interiorly
sovereignly

the rock, you attacked it
up there, on the surface, your waters knocked against it, knocked against it, knocked again in vain
it did not move a hair
but here, in the depression, you accomplished that from which, in the light of day, you had been prevented

you struck the rock
you reached it
you shook it
you pierced it
you eroded it
you shattered it
you split it
you pulverized it

and the donkeys, and the goats
you made butchery of them
you drowned them
you made them eat their shit
you smashed their heads
you slit their throats
you put an apple in their mouth
you drove a knife into their head
you tore out their eyes, which you gave to the fish to eat
you opened their belly
you extirpated the viscera
then you threw it all back into the sun
on a forgotten bank
and you let the flies and worms do their work

from time to time, you passed by there again
and it stank of old carrion
these effluvia were perfumes to you

## **FUITES MINEURES** (Minor Fugues)

**EPIGRAPH** We are 13, 15, 17, and have an immense thirst for space.

**Éditions Mémoire d'encrier** Year: 2014 Pages: 202 ISBN Paper: 978-2-89712-254-6 ISBN Digital: 978-2-89712-255-3

**SUMMARY** Youths launch themselves onto the road, fleeing the world drawn for them. They lose themselves in the woods, flood the streets and the parties. They run their revolt, scream their camaraderie.

_Fuites mineures_ is a wild song that bursts frontiers and horizons. A rhythmic adventure where the body, the oral, and the instant take precedence.

Joyrides. French kisses, blotters, sensations. Hitching trips. Spins in the car. Expeditions in the cities. An ephemeral community with bizarre nicknames. We are 13, 15, 17, and have an immense thirst for space.

"It is not a book about adolescence. It is the flight screaming through me."

**SHORT EXCERPT** And in vain I went to Montreal and in vain I frenched and in vain I did more, and took mush again sometimes and took trips and went to new cities, and tried to lose myself in every way in vain in vain, there was no longer as much excess and no longer as much ardor and no longer as much speed, I never found it again the intensity the great great intensity the immense minor power, like when we tripped at a show and we said It’s powerful and we said It’s violent and we said It rips, I never found that bliss again except sometimes in writing and that is why these fugues.

**LONG EXCERPT** Jo and Dédé I went to their place dozens of times and they came to my place a couple of times less often than me to theirs because I lived in the country there was nothing to do at our place and I didn’t have a Playstation and no cable and no Jos. Louis nothing really interesting except maybe my father’s bison but we got tired of them fast. So often on weeknights and the weekend I went to Jo’s or I went to Dédé’s and we did things together. Usually we did nothing much interesting we watched hockey and the sports news and our hockey cards or we rode around on bikes we crossed other kids in the village we went to the arena that kind of thing. But that time that weekend Jo he had a girlfriend he had told me I’m going out with Stèf if you want you can come we’re gonna go to her friend Mart’s. And I was jealous that he had a girlfriend and not me but I had nothing better to do anyway so I said O.K. and we walked together in the village and we met his girlfriend and we went to Mart’s who I knew a little not a lot. His girlfriend she didn’t come from Thurso she came from Papineauville she didn’t have a good reputation she was just thirteen fourteen but everyone talked about her like a slut they said she fucked and she changed guys all the time and that kind of thing that’s how guys talked about girls like Stèf it wasn’t sweet. And Jo he knew it and he said those things too but he didn’t give a fuck he was all proud all happy to have a girlfriend was Jo. And while we walked in the streets to go to Mart’s they held hands Jo and Stèf, and me I was all jealous I’d never held a girl by the hand me never frenched never done anything and I would have wanted to me too. We arrived at Mart’s at Mart’s parents’ place but the parents they weren’t there so we had the house to ourselves alone. It was a house on the street that goes down toward the river toward the ferry a poor house. And it was Thurso the town with the pulp and paper factory the town where it stinks all the time so it stank it was Thurso. And Mart she was skinny maybe she didn’t eat enough I don’t know anyway she was skinny and all pale Mart. And we had hung out in the shed behind the house, Mart had made a sort of refuge of it a boudoir but you wouldn’t have said boudoir more like a shed a shack where she went to be alone and invite her friends sometimes. Then after we went into the house we settled on the sofa to watch a movie. And me all that time I looked at Stèf and I looked at Jo, I looked at Jo and Stèf but I looked especially at Stèf, she was already developed that girl she had breasts and she had hips and she had dark skin and she had very very black hair, I think she must have had Indian blood that girl she was racy as you wish I found her beautiful I was jealous. She wore lipstick too and she must have realized I was checking her out Stèf. I could have looked at Mart I could have tried to get close to Mart but I didn’t even think of it that we could have been together with Mart, that it would have been normal that we hook up Mart and me it would have made two couples two couples of friends Jo and Stèf and then Mart and me. For me the girl who frenches and the girl one can touch was Stèf because I saw her in front of me frenching my friend Jo and letting herself be touched by my friend Jo who was maybe not really my friend but still. And Mart she wasn’t ugly she was even cute I think, she had curly brown hair and a fine face she wasn’t ugly Mart but she was skinny and dry she didn’t have breasts. And anyway she didn’t look at me Mart she must have been shy, she didn’t look at me Mart whereas Stèf looked at me, she saw that I was ogling her Stèf and she threw me looks, she had lipstick and mascara and black makeup around the eyes and she shot me these looks through her black outlines and her mascara lashes.

## **COULÉES** (Gullies)

**EPIGRAPH** That in greater and stronger, more fluid, all this be carried away and drowned at last.

**Éditions Mémoire d'encrier** Year: 2012 Pages: 100 ISBN Paper: 978-2-923713-70-0 ISBN Digital: 978-2-89712-028-3

**SUMMARY** _Coulées_: the Patapédia, the Outaouais, and the Lower Saint-Lawrence. Three narratives, three places, three crossings. In the tangle of ranges, villages, and cities, dreams are made and unmade until the shattering of the territory.

Writing of the voice. Writing of the road. A prose carried by friendship and the force of landscapes.

**SHORT EXCERPT** I would keep, from all those years of fetters and isolation, an insatiable thirst for displacement and speed, for cities and voyages, an inextinguishable need for mobility, for current, an impulse of headlong flight. Until the day I no longer had the choice, to continue advancing, but to return upstream and undertake these gullies, through which I would have to stir up depths of the unavowable, to displace masses of inert time, which still held me and pulled me backward. That in greater and stronger, more fluid, all this be carried away and drowned—and finally remain imprinted, for each territory recrossed, only the color and the vivid movement of a river.

**LONG EXCERPT** Village after village, the bus emptied. Toward the end, often, there was only the driver and me, and also sometimes a last little old man, or a little old lady, who, seated right at the front, entertained the driver with things of no importance. 

I sat right at the back, scowling in my solitude. I looked out the window. On the other side of the river, high-tension lines scarred dense and round mountains. One glimpsed successively: a freight train, a garage, a covered bridge, a hamlet, a disused station. But from what they had built, everywhere, men seemed to have absented themselves. It was a mineral world, with walls of rock, with machines of iron, a world that risked at any moment breaking into great landslides of cliffs. Jostled at the back of the bus, I swallowed a few more kilometers of desolation.

When, at the turn of a meander, surged finally the bridge so awaited: the bridge of the Plateaux. The bus stopped some hundred meters further, in the parking lot of a restaurant/gas station: Chez Pitre. The name shone at the summit of an iron pole, inside a sign in the shape of a star.

I see my father through the tinted glass, he is waiting for me. I get down. I am so happy to find him again! We kiss, on the mouth. The trip will have been a painful interval of void and solitude between two parents, between two embraces.

I get into the father’s pickup. He is a strong and broad man, with thick hands, with shoulders forged by the work of the farm and the wood. The man and the truck seem to have been cast in a single mold: same build, same strength, same assurance. I risk nothing anymore—I believe I risk nothing anymore, well installed in the cabin of the vehicle, sheltered under the fusiform wing of the hood, my father at the wheel.

Outside, winter unleashes itself more beautifully than ever. The man braved the storm to come get me, and that makes me warm inside. The flakes deviate on the unbreakable windshield. The wheels of the pickup bite into the snow. The truck rolls gently toward the bridge of the Plateaux. My father is taking me back home.

The storm, the cold, the torments, the hostility of the world break against the angles of the solid hull that shelters us. We advance in the world, and at the same time we are protected from it.

## **RELIEF** (Relief)

**EPIGRAPH** I speak of the place where speech is scream—and whirring of engines and screaming of brakes

**Éditions du Noroît** Year: 2011 Pages: 112 ISBN Paper: 978-2-89018-725-2

**SUMMARY** "The earth is flat to fathers who tire the soil of the plateaus to the point of forgetting the gulfs that split them and that we call coulées. But wells up, from the bottom of a coulée, the voice of the abandoned sons—word of anger springing from the fold of the earth to shake the foundations of the fatherland above."

_Relief_ invites to this confrontation, in a seismic poetic prose, where the inhabitants of the village of L’Ascension, and more particularly Romu, its founding father, waver under the attack of the weather and the words.

**SHORT EXCERPT** Here the flatness of the plateaus undoes itself: surfaces of snow buckled like sheets of metal—furrows and protrusions slashing the flanks and faces of the geography—gaping gulfs plunging between the mountains. And the groaning of frozen trees—and the crumpling of sheeted snow: to the eyes and ears Romu, the relief.

**LONG EXCERPT** In the vision of displacement, the decor organizes itself in concentric circles: in the foreground, the trunks move fast, skirting the pickup closely; in the middle ground, the trees pass at medium speed, like walkers; in the background finally, the dense of the forest turns very slowly—at the speed of the earth. At the hazard of the rotation, the wheel of the decor produces radials of perfectly aligned trees.

Finally the wheel of the decor immobilizes: the radials fix themselves in the middle of a recess. The red orange squares of the vest camouflage themselves in the colors of autumn; the orange chainsaw and the red jerrycan in falling melt into the carpet of leaves; the hook and the ax lie on the ground like leftovers of delimbing.

The wind rises—and the eyes Romu, on the foliage that stirs a thousand tones of red and yellow: the sugared red of the red maple, the greenish yellow of the poplar, the whitish yellow of the birch, the burnt orange of the black maple—mad tremblings of the hardwoods troubling the solidity of the conifers tinted with green and black.

The yellowish light of day filters through the canopy of foliage. It rains big damp maple leaves that stick to your body—and to the hood and windows of the pickup.

Silhouette melted into the autumn decor, Romu—on the vertical plane of the naked trunks, between carpet and foliage.

Gasoline poured, chain sharpened. This gait of the lumberjack through woods: horse foot, bird eye: boots sunk in the leaves up to the ankles; head lost in the heights. Hook on the shoulder, always. Saw in hand, held by the handle above, blade behind. That way too of placing the hand on a tree one is going to fell, of going up the trunk with the gaze to the foliage. That slowness of the decision. That sure evaluation of the felling terrain. That previsualization of the fall, as if falling already: on this side, in the clearing between the birches, some thirty feet. And the invisible marking of the cut line on the circumference of the trunk. The starter cord pulled, the mechanical noise seizes the trees. The revolutions of the engine immediately diminish. The noise for a time stifled: the chainsaw hiccups in the dead leaves. The cutting chain turns in jerks. The tool gives off a bluish smoke that cuts against the colors of autumn.

The chainsaw now held in hand—like a bad dog held on a leash. In front, a great yellow birch: coppery bark, recurled; oval branching, solid. The gas flows into the cylinders. The pistons go mad under the blow of the explosions. The noise pierces the trees and the clouds. The smoke propagates in the branches of the birch—colors the foliage in blue yellow.

The decor burns with the hot and cold colors of forest fires: and the red and yellow of the fire, and the blue and white of the smoke. The flames caress the trunks and branches; the hardwoods are bouquets of flames; the conifers are lit torches. The sound of needles crackling; the noise of cones exploding. And suddenly the crash of a tree falling—all its length on the dead leaves. The ember brooding under the carpet; the soil heating from within; the humus on fire contained, smoking: the very bark of the earth quietly, burning.

## TRANSLATION

**SURQUALIFIÉ** 
Lettres à des sociétés sans visage

Translation of **OVERQUALIFIED**

Author: Joey Comeau Translator: Mahigan Lepage Éditions Mémoire d'encrier Year: 2017 Pages: 126 ISBN Paper: 978-2-89712-399-4 ISBN Digital: 978-2-89712-400-7

**SUMMARY** The narrative is constructed as a series of cover letters for positions in different corporations. Each letter is at once a manifesto against the multinational and a diary entry revealing an aspect of the narrator's life, a young Acadian mourning his little brother killed by a drunk driver. _Surqualifié_ is an inventive, funny, caustic, and subversive text.
